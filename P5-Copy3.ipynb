    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company, which was formed in 1985 by, Kenneth Lay. This corporation filed for bankruptcy on December 2001. Enron case is famous for being the largest bankruptcy reorganization the biggest audit failure in American history at that time. <br>\n",
    "In this project, we are asked to use the Enron email data and identify employees who may have committed fraud and were involved in the Enron scam (AKA Persons of Interest). The Person of Interest (POI) is defined as “individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity”<br>\n",
    "In this project I am going to use Machine Learning to build an identifier that predicts whether somebody is a POI or not, using financial and email data for 146 executives.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "to accomplish these kinds of goals, machine learning algorythms are very usefull because they can produce more accurate and more complex models faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are useful in trying to accomplish goals like this one because they can process datasets way faster than humans and they can spot relevant trends that humans would have a hard time realizing manually."
