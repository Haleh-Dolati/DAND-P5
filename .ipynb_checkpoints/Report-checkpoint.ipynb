    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company, which was formed in 1985 by, Kenneth Lay. This corporation filed for bankruptcy on December 2001. Enron case is famous for being the largest bankruptcy reorganization the biggest audit failure in American history at that time. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are asked to use the Enron email data and identify employees who may have committed fraud and were involved in the Enron scam, using machine learning. Machine learning algorythms are very usefull to accomplish these kinds of goals, because they can produce  complex models faster and more accurate than humans.  \n",

    "The Person of Interest (POI) is defined as “individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity”<br>\n",

    "In this project I am going to use Machine Learning to build an identifier that predicts whether somebody is a POI or not, using financial and email data for 146 executives.<br>\n",
