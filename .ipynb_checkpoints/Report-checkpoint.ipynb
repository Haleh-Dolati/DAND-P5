    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company, which was formed in 1985 by, Kenneth Lay. This corporation filed for bankruptcy on December 2001. Enron case is famous for being the largest bankruptcy reorganization the biggest audit failure in American history at that time. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are asked to use the Enron email data and identify employees who may have committed fraud and were involved in the Enron scam, using machine learning. Machine learning algorythms are very usefull to accomplish these kinds of goals, because they can produce  complex models faster and more accurate than humans.<br>\n",
    "The goal is to make a model that uses some financial and email to identify Persons of Interest  among all executives. The Person of Interest (POI) is defined as “individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity”<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mentioned informations are avaiable in Enron Email data which became public after the federal investigation of Enro scandal. This data has financial and email features as well as POI label which shoes whether an executive was a POI as well. The features are: <br>\n",
    "$\\qquad$ **Financial features:** \n",
    "salary, deferral_payments, total_payments, loan_advances, bonus, restricted_stock_deferred, deferred_income, total_stock_value, expenses, exercised_stock_options, other', long_term_incentive, restricted_stock, director_fees <br>\n",
    "$\\qquad$ **Email features:** to_messages, email_address, from_poi_to_this_person, from_messages, from_this_person_to_poi, shared_receipt_with_poi <br>\n"

    "## Data Cleaning and Outliers\n",
    "The first step is to get knowing the data and find and handle possible problems. First, I took a look at the name of the executives. Over all thereare 146 executves in this data which 18 of them are POIs. The last two names **Total** and **The Travel Agency In The Park** are different from the rest. Total is the sum of all financial features therefore does not represent any executive just like The Travel Agency In The Park.  Therefore, I excluded them from the data. \n",
